# psimon

## A Simon-like game, with a variable number of sequence buttons.  

Written by Brian Cardellini as part of [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com)'s front end development program.

Written in Jade, Less, SVG, and ES6 (see src folder).  After `npm install`, `npm run dev` will watch source files and lint, sourcemap, and compile them to /pubic files with jade, lessc, browserify, and babel, and open a browser pointing to a new local server for those public files.  `npm run prod` will compile and minify /src files to /public (without watching, serving, or sourcemapping).
